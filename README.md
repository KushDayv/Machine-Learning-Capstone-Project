### Machine-Learning-Capstone-Project
This is a project done to test how far one is in terms of understanding the various Machine Learning Concepts.


#### How to tell if a Dataset can be used for Regressio or Classification.

1. Nature of the Target variable:- For regression, the target variable is Numerical/Continous, while for Classification, the target variable should be categorical.

2. Distribution of Target variable:- Regression checks on the distribution of teh target variables, while Classificaiton checks on the distribution of class labels.

#### CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process)

This is a framework that is widely used to provide structured approach to planning, executing, evaluation of data using machine learning models. 

##### Advantages of using CRISP-DM

1. Standardization - the framework provides a common language and understanding for Data mining process.

2. Structured Approach - the framework guides through each stage of the project.

3. Flexibility - the framework is adaptable to different data mining goals.

4. Reduced Risk - the framework minimizes on confusion.

##### Phases of CRISP-DM

1. Business understanding - defines the business objective and problem.

2. Data understanding - Explore the available data in terms of quality of the features, presence of outliers, missing values, duplicates etc.

3. Data Preparation - cleaning, transformation, preparation.

4. Modelling - involves the selection of the appropriate model to achieve the desired outcome.

5. Evaluation - this involves evaluating the model in terms of performance metrics, comparisons.

6. Deployment - Intergrates the chosen model to production monitor performance.
